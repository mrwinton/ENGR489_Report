\begin{abstract}

The ability to connect innovative ideas to people and resources is a critical part of the innovation process. This project is concerned with empowering the innovation community with an online collaboration system that: engages the various roles present in the innovation ecosystem, functions on the notion of scoping/trust and ensures that all sensitive intellectual property shared is stored in a secure manner.
