\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
This chapter discusses the project's contributions, and reflects on the requirements with regard to the evaluation conducted. Finally, potential future work is identified and summarised.

\section{Contributions}
The project's principal contributions are as follows:

\paragraph{C1: User stories describing collaboration in the innovation community.} 

Existing user stories of collaboration in the innovation community do not exist. As such new user stories were specified with an emphasis on networking/collaborating around ideas. These stories specify the following: engagement of all roles within the innovation community, the ability to scope content's disclosure, and audit who has seen ideas that you have initiated.

\paragraph{C2.1: A PitchHub prototype.} 

Built on the popular Ruby on Rails framework, the prototype was developed to support the user stories specified. Having followed good coding practices this artefact is open to future extensions.

\paragraph{C2.2: A PitchHub prototype deployed to Callaghan Innovation.} 




\paragraph{C2.3: A PitchHub prototype with Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme integrated.}
