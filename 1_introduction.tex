\chapter{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to design, prototype and evaluate PitchHub, an on online collaboration system that empowers the innovation community. This is achieved by engaging the various roles present in the innovation ecosystem, functioning on the notion of scoping/trust and ensuring that all sensitive intellectual property shared is stored in a secure manner. This is an industry project in association with Callaghan Innovation.


\section{Motivation}
The deep integration of digital media within modern society has had a profound effect on how we communicate and collaborate with others. Historically innovation had a great deal to do with proximity. Knowledge of the problem and access to the resources required to solve the problem were the primary limiting factors. In the digital age, the move online has essentially obviated this need for proximity. 

As a result the innovation community has been able to tackle problems regardless of geography. Despite this, Callaghan Innovation that the innovation community is to a large extent still fragmented. There are three primary causes for this.
First, the current solutions used in the innovation space for collaboration either focus on networking around people rather than the ideas \cite{Linkedin:online}\cite{Googlegroups:online} or only facilitate collaboration between certain roles in the innovation community (e.g. investors, inventors, entrepreneurs) \cite{100open:online}\cite{Pledge:online}\cite{Angel:online}\cite{Quirky:online}. Second, contributing intellectual property online requires a significant amount of trust as once submitted the original poster has limited control over their intellectual property's dissemination. Third, as the presence cyber threats grow \cite{Cybersecurity:online} services facilitating innovation need to have security measures in place that protect stored intellectual property from potential malicious access.

\section{Project Objectives}\label{S:projectObjectives}

A solution to the above issues is to use a system that is specifically designed for engaging the innovation community, that enables contributors the ability to control the scope of their intellectual property's dissemination, and that ensures security of this intellectual property.
The aim of this project has been to design, implement and evaluate this solution, henceforth referred to as PitchHub.

The issues identified above may be solved by implementing a system known as PitchHub. This system will be a responsive web application that supports all roles within the innovation ecosystem. In doing so PitchHub will be able to facilitate collaboration for a large percentage of the collaboration community. PitchHub will also provide functionality for explicit scoping so that users may control the openness of their IP. Finally, PitchHub will store data securely on distributed infrastructure, in doing so not only will user IP be protected but the solution may be scaled to serve innovation communities outside of New Zealand. Ultimately, this solution may be used to serve as a central hub of the innovation community to co-create ideas and connections.
