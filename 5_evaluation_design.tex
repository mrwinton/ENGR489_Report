wiki: SecretSharing

The disadvantage of unconditionally secure secret sharing schemes is that the storage and transmission of the shares requires an amount of storage and bandwidth resources equivalent to the size of the secret times the number of shares. If the size of the secret were significant, say 1 GB, and the number of shares were 10, then 10 GB of data must be stored by the shareholders

talk about NN threshold

\section{Security Testing Method}

\subsection{Security Testing Scope}

Our threat model consists of resisting at least one shoulder surfing attack from an observer co-located at any position around the tabletop. Camera-based attacks are feasible with most knowledge-based authentication systems; but to defeat camera attacks was not our design goal. The pervasive na- ture of mobile devices instrumented with cameras is of particular concern, but as with other manifestations of this same problem (e.g. at the ATM) we rely upon social conventions to deter active attempts to video record logins.
